# Java Web Library Service + Angular CLI

### This is just the simple web of the public library in Warsaw. We can visit the page try to find book which we need and if we want just borrow it.

### To create this website I used the database web service which was created in Spring Boot and Hibernate. Addionally I used the Angular CLI to create the fronted of the website.

### To build the mechanism of the registration and login I used the Firebase for Angular. 

### The search mechanism for books works correctly but I still work on login mechanism but I will be finished soon.
